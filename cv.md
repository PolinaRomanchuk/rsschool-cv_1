## About me
I chose the IT field because of the desire to develop a product that will be useful to people, as well as because of the desire to develop my skills and self-improvement.   
My strengths are the ability to learn quickly, the ability to work well in a team and independently.

## My Skills
* JS;

* Visual Studio.

## Code examples

``` JS
var humanYearsCatYearsDogYears = function(humanYears) {
  let catYears;
  let dogYears;
  if (humanYears == 1)
    {
      catYears = dogYears = 15;
    }
   else if (humanYears == 2)
    {
      catYears = dogYears = 24;
    }
   else if (humanYears > 2)
    {
      let ageDifference = humanYears - 2;
      catYears = dogYears = 24;
      for (let i = 0; i < ageDifference; i++)
        {
          catYears+=4;
          dogYears+=5;
        }
    };
  return [humanYears, catYears, dogYears];
}
```
